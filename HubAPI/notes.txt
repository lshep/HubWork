## Some Initial Thoughts
Convert sqlite to parquet to work with a new dplyr interface
Have a contributions like current submission process with github actions for validation
Transition to csv add, update, delete with metadata to make sqlite/duckdb/etc/parquet 
?? How is logging set up to keep track of activity??


## download current sqlite files
wget https://experimenthub.bioconductor.org/metadata/experimenthub.sqlite3
wget https://annotationhub.bioconductor.org/metadata/annotationhub.sqlite3


## General conversion of sqlite table to parquet
## duckdb -c "ATTACH 'your_database.sqlite' AS db; COPY db.your_table TO 'output.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);"

Do we want all current tables or can/should we change it?
Do we combine certain information into one table and consoladate down other? (Seans conversation about including information as json?)
